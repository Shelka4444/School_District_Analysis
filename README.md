# School District Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this project was to examine 15 different high school's math and reading scores based on a variety of metrics (schools size, spending per student, school type, etc.). Due to academic dishonesty, grades were omitted in the data set at the 9th grade level from Thomas High School. These findings were presented to the school board committee who will then decide how to allocate funds for the following academic year.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

The school district summary was not significantly affected by the removal of 461 9th grade Thomas High School student grades out of 39,170 total students in the data set. The Average Math Score was 78.9, a 0.1 decrease from the prior summary.
